## About Scrimba


Scrimba Twitter Clone bootcamp project. 

A dynamic replication of Twitter's core features, this project put a spotlight on advanced JavaScript operations, particularly the manipulation of array objects. I delved into array methods to manage data effectively, crafted unique identifiers using UUID generation, and implemented conditional rendering to apply styles dynamically.
